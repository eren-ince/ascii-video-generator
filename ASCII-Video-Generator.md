# ASCII Video Generator

This is a tool to generate ASCII art videos from a set of images or videos. The tool uses Rust and Python programming languages to create an output file that can be played in a terminal. The Rust code is responsible for processing the input files and creating ASCII frames, while the Python code is responsible for playing the resulting video in the terminal.

## Installation

To use this tool, you will need to have Rust and Python 3 installed on your computer.

### Rust Installation

You can download Rust from the official website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### Python Installation

You can download Python from the official website: [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have both Rust and Python installed, you can clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymfyw/ascii-video-generator.git
```

Then, navigate to the project folder and run the following command to build the Rust code:

```bash
cd ascii-video-generator/rust && cargo build --release
```
